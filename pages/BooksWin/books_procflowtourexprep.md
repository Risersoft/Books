# Tour Expense Reporting

1. If anyone needs advance for tour expenses, he has to give Tour Advance Requisition:

    **New ->Voucher-> Tour Advance Requisition**

To pay advance payment for tour expenses against Tour Advance Requisition, you have to create Payment Travel:

    **New -> Payment -> Payment Travel**

2. Then employee has to create Tour Expense Report when he came back from tour to give the tour expense detail:

    **New -> Voucher->Tour Expense Report**

Adjust advance payment in Tour Expense Report and create Payment Travel according to expenses.



**Notes:**

-  Do not create any accounting voucher which contains accounts receivable or accounts payable

-  If tour advance is pending, create tour expense report to adjust the balance. Tour expense reports contains provision for amount transfer to another imprest or to office cash.
