# Expense Voucher Reporting

1. If anyone needs advance for tour expense, he has to give Expense Advance Requisition:

    **New ->Voucher-> Expense Advance Requisition**

To pay advance payment for tour expenses against Expense Advance Requisition, you have to create Payment Travel:

    **New -> Payment -> Payment Travel**

2. Then employee has to create Expense Voucher Report when he came back from tour to give the tour expense detail:

    **New -> Voucher->Expense Voucher Report**

Adjust advance payment in Expense Voucher Report and create Payment Travel according to expenses.



**Notes:**

-  Do not create any accounting voucher which contains accounts receivable or accounts payable

-  If expense advance is pending, create expense voucher report to adjust the balance. Expense voucher reports contains provision for amount transfer to another imprest or to office cash.
