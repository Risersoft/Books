# Import through Freight Forwarded

We can import items in two ways:

1. **Direct Import:** In this way, we import items directly from other party. For this, we have to create-

Material Voucher -> Invoice (Pricing Procedure-Direct Import)

2. **Courier Import:** In this way, we import items through third party. For this, we have to create-

Material Voucher-> Invoice (Pricing Procedure-Direct Import)->Third Party Bill (Pricing Procedure- Courier Import)
