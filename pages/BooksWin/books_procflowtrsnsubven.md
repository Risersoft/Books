# Transfer to Subcontracting Vendor (421) and Receive against Transfer (425)



Movement code 421 defines the transfer from own stock to SC Vendor. If we want to transfer own stock to other campus, we can assign campus name as SC Vendor. Sub-contracting may be for job work including any testing services.
